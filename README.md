# New Project template

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This is a template for a new project. It should contain the following
folders:

  - 000\_scoping
  - 001\_projectname.taskpaper (flatfile with list of tasks for project)
  - 002\_emails\_and\_meetings
  - 003\_literature
  - 100\_data\_cleaning\_scripts\_EDA
  - 100\_data\_raw
  - 200\_data\_clean
  - 400\_analysis
  - 500\_report
  - 999\_other

You can create other interim(ly) indexed folders between these if you
need the flexibility of multiple folders for analysis/outputs.

If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents,
Google docs) that are linked to the project, they should be listed in
this document.
