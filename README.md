# New Project template

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This is a template for a new project. It should contain the following
folders:

  - 000\_scoping
  - 001\_projectname.taskpaper (flatfile with list of tasks for project)
  - 002\_emails\_and\_meetings
  - 003\_literature
  - 100\_data\_cleaning\_scripts\_EDA
  - 100\_data\_raw
  - 200\_data\_clean
  - 400\_analysis
  - 500\_report
  - 999\_other

You can create other interim(ly) indexed folders between these if you
need the flexibility of multiple folders for analysis/outputs.

If there are other resouces (e.g., Data stored elsewhere, literature stored elsewhere) that are linked to the project, they should be listed in this document.

In general, data should not be uploaded to github and should be excluded via the .gitignore file. A link to, or information on how to get access to the data if you have the correct permissions, should be included.
