# New Project template

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a template for a new project. It should contain the following
folders: 

- 000_scoping
- 001_projectname.taskpaper (flatfile with list of tasks for project)
- 002_emails_and_meetings
- 003_literature
- 100_data_cleaning_scripts_EDA
- 100_data_raw
- 200_data_clean
- 400_analysis
- 500_report
- 999_other

You can create other interim(ly) indexed folders between these if you need the flexibility of multiple folders for analysis/outputs.


If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents, Google docs) that are linked to the project, they should be listed in this document.
